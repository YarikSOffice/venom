     * Terminates the process when the app is ready to commit suicide.
     *
     * If the system kills a process, the associated app can restore its activities that have
     * a state in a new process. An activity is considered to have a state in two cases:
     * 1. It hasn't resumed yet (an empty state).
     * 2. The activity manager service has gotten its last saved state. This happens right
     * after [onStop] and [onSaveInstanceState] events.
     *
     * Our goal is to restore the same back stack once the app is recreated. To achieve this,
     * we kill the process as soon as:
     * 1. [DeathActivity] is resumed - to remove it from the stack.
     * 2. The activity manager service gets the last saved state of the activities that
     * haven't stopped yet - to keep them in the stack.
     *
     * When [DeathActivity] is being resumed we schedule a suicide attempt with a delay.
     * This delay is long enough to check if there are any activities that haven't stopped yet.
     * In case we have them, we postpone the suicide until the activity manager service gets
     * the last saved state of such the activities.

         * 1. Invokes [onStop] and [onSaveInstanceState] methods along with associated
         * [ActivityLifecycleCallbacks] (the order depends on the targetSdkVersion).
         * 2. Reports the last activity saved state to the activity manager service. This *Report*
         * is enqueued via the UI thread [Handler] in the same call with the previous step.
         *
         * Given that, our goal is to terminate the process as soon as the *Report* is processed.
         * To achieve this, we use a nested [Handler.post] call:
         * 1. The outer runnable is enqueued inside [onActivityStopped] callback and is processed
         * when the *Report* is already in the message queue.
         * 2. We post the inner runnable which is guaranteed to be processed after the *Report*.
